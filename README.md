### ðŸ‘‹
I am a computer engineering student at the University of Washington, with a minor in digital arts and experimental media. I have a passion for creating and programming interactive installations that engage and inspire audiences. 

I applied my skills in computer engineering, digital arts, and experimental media, as well as my knowledge of user experience, design thinking, and project management. I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to learn new technologies, explore new forms of expression, and collaborate with diverse and talented people.
